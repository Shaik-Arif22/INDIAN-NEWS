# INDIAN-NEWS
News is that part of communication that keeps us informed of the changing events, issues and characters in the outside world. The world is going to be more digital, and digitalization is the need of every business, every industry. An Online portal plays a vital role in educating and informing people with latest updates, current happenings around the globe. In this busy world people do not have much time to spend on reading a printed newspaper with yesterday’s happenings so they need to be updated with latest news at an instant. Many websites of individual newspapers offer news but are centralized over the articles and authors of a limited set of people that is the respective parent website. Our website overcomes this by providing you articles and news coverages all over the internet collectively at one site. The other major problem that is resolved is many websites give personalized news which limits the user’s knowledge. Whereas this project gives the users news articles fetched directly from news api which gives users non personalized news. This website gives user easier accessibility, fastest and latest news updates minute to minute.
